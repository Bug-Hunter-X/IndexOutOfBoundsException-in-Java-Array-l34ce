# IndexOutOfBoundsException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common error in Java: the IndexOutOfBoundsException.  The bug.java file contains code that attempts to access an array element beyond its valid index range.  The bugSolution.java file provides a corrected version.

The error is a result of misunderstanding array indexing in Java (0-based indexing).

## How to run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run bug.java (expect an exception).
3. Compile and run bugSolution.java (expect correct output).
